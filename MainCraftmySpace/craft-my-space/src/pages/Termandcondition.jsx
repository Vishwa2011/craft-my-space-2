//                     <li>Fillers will be placed 50-80 mm by the walls, 80-100mm fillers on the top, 100 mm base where applicable and possible joints where width / height exceeds 2700 mm.</li>
//                     <li>Variations may occur in the colour and tone of materials due to their composition. The company cannot guarantee exact colour consistency throughout the range of materials used but will achieve this within an acceptable tolerance.</li>
//                     <li>Some panels are produced in decorative materials – particularly Gloss finishes – and therefore can be easily damaged and should be protected against marking. The Company is not responsible for any marking caused to any panels after installation</li>
//                     <li>To make a claim, simply contact us in writing, by telephone or e-mail and we will directly find a solution together with you. By emailing and attaching a photo, we can act fast and straight away see what needs to be done.</li>
//                     <li>The Customer is responsible to ensure that where necessary any planning consents or building regulations are obtained in respect of any goods provided under this agreement.</li>
//                     <li>Natural wood is used in some of our products and fitted wardrobes. As a natural material wood reflects the endless variety of grains, shades and textures found in the nature and such variances can be expected. All timber products will mellow under exposure of time. PVC, laminates and melamine finishes are also subject to slight colour changes over a period of years. Unless specified otherwise, any reference made to wood or timber whether solid or veneered refers to door and drawer fronts only. Colour reproduction in our descriptive literature is as close as reproductive techniques allow. Laminate worktops with a textured finish give good wear and resistance, also colour fastness and heat resistance up to 120 degrees Celsius. The company cannot be responsible for burn marks caused by items in excess of this temperature. Worktops should not be subject to excessive heat or water as this could cause swelling of the joint. We strongly recommend the use of a chopping board when cutting.</li>

If the company terminates this agreement under these conditions, any deposit paid will be refunded in full. Customers should not undertake work or expense based on this contract until such time as the company has confirmed a delivery date after the technical survey and recosting has taken place and both parties have agreed any changes.</li>

                <h4>9.Specification</h4>
                <ul style={{lineHeight:'30px'}} >
                    <li>Fillers will be placed 50-80 mm by the walls, 80-100mm fillers on the top, 100 mm base where applicable and possible joints where width / height exceeds 2700 mm.</li>
                    <li>Variations may occur in the colour and tone of materials due to their composition. The company cannot guarantee exact colour consistency throughout the range of materials used but will achieve this within an acceptable tolerance.</li>
                    <li>Some panels are produced in decorative materials – particularly Gloss finishes – and therefore can be easily damaged and should be protected against marking. The Company is not responsible for any marking caused to any panels after installation</li>
                    <li>To make a claim, simply contact us in writing, by telephone or e-mail and we will directly find a solution together with you. By emailing and attaching a photo, we can act fast and straight away see what needs to be done.</li>
                    <li>The Customer is responsible to ensure that where necessary any planning consents or building regulations are obtained in respect of any goods provided under this agreement.</li>
                    <li>Natural wood is used in some of our products and fitted wardrobes. As a natural material wood reflects the endless variety of grains, shades and textures found in the nature and such variances can be expected. All timber products will mellow under exposure of time. PVC, laminates and melamine finishes are also subject to slight colour changes over a period of years. Unless specified otherwise, any reference made to wood or timber whether solid or veneered refers to door and drawer fronts only. Colour reproduction in our descriptive literature is as close as reproductive techniques allow. Laminate worktops with a textured finish give good wear and resistance, also colour fastness and heat resistance up to 120 degrees Celsius. The company cannot be responsible for burn marks caused by items in excess of this temperature. Worktops should not be subject to excessive heat or water as this could cause swelling of the joint. We strongly recommend the use of a chopping board when cutting.</li>
